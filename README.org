There are two ways
1. install =StyloaiX= addon in [[https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts][userChromeJS manager from xiaoxiaoflood]] (recommended)

** Sidebar related
Only test on macOS, welcome PR for other OS.
I use [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/][Sidebery]] personally.
*** hide tab bar when sidebar is enabled
**** requirement
   - =window_control_placeholder_support.css=
   - =hide_tabs_toolbar_osx.css= or =hide_tabs_toolbar_windows.css= based on your operating systems
*** sidebar switch
   switch between normal tab bar, always-on sidebar, and auto-hidden sidebar.
   
   It creates a new toolbar button (it looks like the normal sidebar button because I don't have the creativity for a new one).

   Left click: normal rotation.
   
   Right/Middle click: switch between always-on and auto-hidden.
   
**** requirement
   - =window_control_placeholder_support.css=
   - =hide_tabs_toolbar_osx.css=
   - =sidebar_attribute.uc.js=
   - =sidebar_autohide.uc.js=
*** screenshot
